# Modify the hand_rank function so that it returns the
# correct output for the remaining hand types, which are:
# full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pair,
# pair, and high card hands. 
# 
# Do this by completing each return statement below.
#
# You may assume the following behavior of each function:
#
# straight(ranks): returns True if the hand is a straight.
# flush(hand):     returns True if the hand is a flush.
# kind(n, ranks):  returns the first rank that the hand has
#                  exactly n of. For A hand with 4 sevens 
#                  this function would return 7.
# two_pair(ranks): if there is a two pair, this function 
#                  returns their corresponding ranks as a 
#                  tuple. For example, a hand with 2 twos
#                  and 2 fours would cause this function
#                  to return (4, 2).
# card_ranks(hand) returns an ORDERED tuple of the ranks 
#                  in a hand (where the order goes from
#                  highest to lowest rank). 
#
# Since we are assuming that some functions are already
# written, this code will not RUN. Clicking SUBMIT will 
# tell you if you are correct.
